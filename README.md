Simple to use Arduino library to interface to ESP8266 Wifi (802.11 b/g/n) Module

... TBD ...

Connecting To Your Arduino
--------------------------

The ESP8266 is a 3.3 Volt Module, both power and signalling is 3.3v, so you can not connect it directly to a 5v Arduino, you will need to level-shift.

The 3.3v supply must be quite "strong", the on-board 3.3v (if any) that your Arduino supplies may not be sufficient, you will most likely have to give it a 3.3v supply.
